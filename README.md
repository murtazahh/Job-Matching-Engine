# Job-Matching-Engine

This project aims to develop a job matching component that can automatically match job seeker profiles with job descriptions to provide the best job matches to job seekers. The project would involve the following steps:

- Collecting and preprocessing training data from various sources such as resumes and job descriptions
- Selecting relevant features such as resume keywords, location, experience, education, work type, job title, and visa sponsorship
- Choosing and training a suitable model such as a neural network or a decision tree using AWS Sagemaker
- Evaluating and tuning the model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Setting up monitoring for model performance using AWS Cloudwatch or other services
- Deploying the model as a service that can accept a profile as input and return the top x job descriptions that are the best matches as output

The project would also leverage existing research on job recommender systems and use the best practices and techniques from the literature.
